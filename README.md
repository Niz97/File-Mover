# File-Mover
Program to move/sort files based on their extension.
Inspired to make this project to deal with a downloads folder that is always cluttered. At present, it is primarily being used to organise files I download for university work. 

Written in Python 3.
Add desired directory paths to ```mover.py``` and execute by calling ```py mover.py```
